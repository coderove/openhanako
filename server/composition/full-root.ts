 * Mounts the closed-product route surface (avatar, character-cards, cards,
 * desk, diary) on top of whatever `./open-root.ts` already mounted. This
 * file is closed: only `server/main-full.ts` imports it, and
 * `server/index.ts` never does. Every line below is moved verbatim from
 * `server/index.ts`'s old inline mount block (same factory, same
 * arguments, same relative order among these five routes).
